#repo commands
gitty repo
? gitty clone <repo url|path>
gitty repo add <repo url>
gitty repo remove <repo #>

#branch commands
gitty map
gitty map <branch> <path>
gitty map remove <branch>
gitty branch <source branch> <target branch>
gitty pull <branch>

- I don't think that the current branch commands can handle multiple repos  


#change commands
gitty changelist
gitty changelist add 
gitty changelist add <name>
gitty changelist <cl>
gitty changelist add <cl> <folder|file> 
gitty changelist revert <cl> <folder|file>
gitty changelist move <src cl> <dst cl> <folder|file>
gitty changelist commit <cl>

- Alias chagelist commands with cl
- remove/revert changed files given just a folder containing applicable files.

#history commands
gitty history remove <changelist>
gitty history insert <changelist>
gitty log <branch> -u <user> -f <folder/file>

#Diff commands
gitty diff tool <tool cli command>
gitty diff <cl>
gitty diff <file> -r <revision>
gitty diff <branch>:<file> <branch>:<file>
gitty diff <file #> 

- Diffs with no revision specified imply the diff is against HEAD
- Need to be able to diff against HEAD, PREV, or REV #
- Diff commandsed needs more though. Making the CLI easy to use will be a bit 
more complicated than originally thought.


#Status
gitty status
