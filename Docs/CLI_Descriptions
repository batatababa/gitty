#Diff commands (Putting off until base functionality is done)
gitty diff tool <tool cli command>
gitty diff <cl>
gitty diff <file> -r <revision>
gitty diff <branch>:<file> <branch>:<file>

- Need to be able to diff against HEAD, PREV, or REV #
- Diff commandsed needs more though. Making the CLI easy to use will be a bit 
more complicated than originally thought.
